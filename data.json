I liked the trippyness of it and wanted to create something similar using randomness. They also move a tiny bit up, down, left or right to create movement."

    "description": "For the more complex experimenting, I knew I wanted to use flow fields. When working with it, the structures forming started reminding me of stone, specifically marble. So I made the backgroud gray and randomised the color of the lines between black and white using Math.random. "

I also wanted to make them differnt colors and have separate behavior based on color, so the brown ones are faster than the black. "
